**"Girl Gamer"**

A delightfully polarizing term for women who game.  

This is a forum for discussing women in geek culture and for women to relate experiences that occur as a result of their gender.

We're fighting the good fight against the [phenomenon](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19) stated by the [Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect), and developing a community of mutual respect, so we can all have a pretty sweet time.

Or you know, just post some bad ass makeup tutorials inspired by video games. We like that stuff here!
